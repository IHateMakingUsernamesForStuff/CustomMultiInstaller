# CustomMultiInstaller
Ninite but offline and with any program! 
Installation and usage instructions are in the included ReadMe.rtf.

Basically a batch script that installs to C:\Program Files and creates shortcuts automatically.
Excluding the admin prompt, this script requires no intervention.

This script is great for installing multiple programs at once or installing programs without installers.
