# CustomMultiInstaller
Ninite but offline and with any program! 
Installation and usage instructions are in the included readme.txt.

Basically a batch script that installs to C:Program Files and creates shortcuts automatically.

Stuff I May Be Adding:
.zip support, subfolder scanning for shortcuts, and choosing install path
