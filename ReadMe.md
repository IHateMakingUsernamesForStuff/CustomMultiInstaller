# CustomMultiInstaller
Ninite but offline and with any program! 
Installation and usage instructions are in the included Readme.

Basically a batch script that installs to C:\Program Files and creates shortcuts automatically.
Excluding the admin prompt, this script requires no intervention.

This script is great for installing multiple programs at once or installing programs without installers.

(Batch files don't have source code, edit it directly.)
